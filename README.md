# Wiz

> A refreshingly simple request module for Deno that is built upon fetch.

## Notice

Wiz is very early in stage, so please make sure you lock your versions to reduce confusing errors from breaking changes.

## Goals

- Support all types of request methods supported by fetch.

- Have JSDoc for all publicly-exposed members.

- `WizClient` class

- Transformer Plugin (transform keys of returned objects)

- Comprehensive testing
